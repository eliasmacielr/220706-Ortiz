An abstract is a brief of the paper; the abstract should not 
contain references, the text of the abstract section should be
in 12 point normal Times New Roman. An abstract is normally of 200 to 300 words. List 4 to 8 keywords all with lowercase (except special cases) for both highlighting the focuses of your study and indexing/searching in databases.

\section{Introduction}

Please use the AIMS template to prepare your manuscript, 
before you submit to our journal. 
Please read carefully the instructions for authors at
http://www.aimspress.com/mbe/news/solo-detail/instructionsforauthors. 


The page size is A4 ($8.5 \times 11.0$ in or $21.59 \times 27.94$ cm). The margin is set to moderate. Font for all text, except symbols and formulae, should use Times New Roman. 

Article title is bold with a font size 16 and aligned to the left. Authors are bold with a font size 12. Using Times New Roman size 12 for the main text, including figure captions and table titles. However, text size for contents in a table can be chosen from 8 to 12 to fit the table within the width of the page.

\section{Materials and methods}
\subsection{Subheading}

\subsubsection{Sub-subheading}
The heading levels should not be more than 4 levels. 
The font of heading and subheadings should be 12 point 
normal Times New Roman. The first letter of headings 
and subheadings should be capitalized.

\section{Results}
The body text is in 12 point normal Times New Roman, 
the line space is at least 15 point.
 


\subsection{Figure/image and caption}
 Leave a space of one line before and after a figure or an image, i.e., one line between the main text and the top of the figure or image, and one line between the bottom of the figure or image and the caption. The caption has a default space of 12 $pt$ after it so the main text can continue below the caption. If no text follows the figure caption, do not leave any space between the caption and the next headline (the headline has a default space). 
 
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figure.pdf}
\caption{Legend of the figure.}
\label{Fig1}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

 
 Figures should be numbered consecutively in the text. A figure can be referred explicitly in the text as Figure~\ref{Fig1}.
 
 Use black and white graphic for line drawings. All lines should be at least 0.1 mm (0.3 $pt$) wide. Line drawings or scanned line drawings should have a resolution at least 600 dpi. Images with a large volume should be properly compressed within 1 MB each. Scanned images should be properly edited to balance the volume size and clarity of the image. 
 
 Figure captions begin with \textbf{Figure x.} in bold, followed by the text. Do not add a full stop at the end of the caption. 

\subsection{Tables and table titles}

Table title should be placed above the table, numbered consecutively, and referred in the text like Table~\ref{table} or (Table~\ref{table}). There is no space between the table and table title. Leave a space of one line above the table title and one line below the bottom of the table. If a new first-level headline follows the table immediately, do not leave the space below the table.

The font of the table title is size 12 but the font of the table contents can be sizes 8 to 12 depending on the best fit for the table. Table title begins with \textbf{Table x}. in bold, followed by the text. 

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{center}
\caption{Caption of the table.}
\begin{tabular}{ccc} \hline
 & & \\\hline
 & & \\
 & & \\
 & & \\\hline
(Three-line table is preferred.)
\end{tabular}
	\label{table}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\subsection{Mathematical formulae}
Mathematical formulae should be numbered consecutively by placing the number in parentheses like (1), one TAB space away from the right line. Mathematical formulae should be typed using MS Word Equation or better using \emph{MathType}. Use size 10--12 for the main characters and size 6--8 for subscripts or superscripts. Leave a space of 6 $pt$ between two formula in separate lines. Some examples are shown below. 

\begin{equation}
\lim_{x \mapsto a^+ }f\left ( x \right )= \pm \infty \qquad \text{or} \qquad \lim_{x \mapsto a^- }f\left ( x \right )= \pm \infty
\label{equation1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\lim_{x \mapsto \infty }f\left ( x \right )=  a \qquad \text{or} \qquad \lim_{x \mapsto -\infty}f\left ( x \right )=  b
\label{equation2}
\end{equation}

To cite a formula in the text, use the number like Equation~\ref{equation1}, or Eq~\ref{equation2}, or alike.



\section{Reference style, citation, and cross-reference}
Journal uses numbered style for referencing. Cite references in the text by placing number(s) in square brackets by the end of a sentence~\cite{A1,A2}, or immediately after the Author’s name, for example, Jackson~\cite{A3} outlined that …. If an article has two authors, list both surnames, e.g., Wang and Guo~\cite{A4} reported …. If an article has more than six authors, use the first author’s surname and et al., e.g., Chen et al.~\cite{A9} studied ….

Three or more consecutive references can be placed in the same square brackets by joining the start number and the end number by a hyphen like~\cite{A5,A6,A7,A8}. References with separate numbers can be placed in the same square brackets with individual numbers separated by comms like~\cite{A2,A6,A9}. We recommend using software such as EndNote, RefWork or Mendeley to manage references. Otherwise, you have to manually edit the references according to different types of publications. Follow the examples shown in the list of references below for different types of publications~\cite{A10,A11,A12}.

We recommend all references are cross-referenced between their appearances in the text and in the Reference list. AIMS production requires that each reference has DOI (if there is one).
